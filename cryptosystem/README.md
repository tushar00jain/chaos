hello, here are some instructions on how to use the encoder ...

## Step 1:

Load an image you want to encode ( smaller is better for now because it's faster )

## Step 2:

the Chaotic image will overwrite the image you have specified so be sure to choose carefully
you may loose it to the chaos ....
